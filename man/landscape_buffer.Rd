\title{Group Deployments by UTM Zones and Buffers}
\usage{
landscape_buffer(dep, buffer_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{dep}{The deployments tabular data describing each camera deployment, including latitude and longitude columns (either `Latitude`/`Longitude` or `latitude`/`longitude`) and a `UTM_zone` column.}

\item{buffer_size}{A numeric value representing the size of the buffer around each point in meters.}
}
\value{
An updated deployments data frame with an additional `Landscape_buff` column that contains unique IDs for each buffered landscape around the camera deployments.
}
\description{
This function buffers camera trap deployment points, accounting for multiple UTM zones. It splits the data by UTM zone, applies a buffer in meters, and re-merges the buffered polygons across zones.
The function also handles overlapping polygons, ensuring unique locationName IDs are assigned to each buffered polygon.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Splits the deployment data by UTM zone to handle buffering separately for each zone.
  \item Buffers points within each UTM zone using the specified buffer size (in meters).
  \item Merges buffered polygons from different UTM zones and assigns unique IDs to each polygon.
  \item Dissolves and disaggregates overlapping polygons, ensuring that each landscape is represented by a unique buffer.
  \item Extracts the unique landscape buffer ID for each deployment point.
}
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
dep <- data.frame(
  deploymentID = c("dep1", "dep2"),
  Latitude = c(-33.8688, -27.4698),
  Longitude = c(151.2093, 153.0251),
  UTM_zone = c(56, 55)
)

# Apply buffer of 5000 meters
buffered_dep <- landscape_buffer(dep, buffer_size = 5000)
table(buffered_dep$Landscape_buff)
