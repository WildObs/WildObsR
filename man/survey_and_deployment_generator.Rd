\title{Determine Single-Season Sampling Efforts from Camera Trap Images}
\usage{
survey_and_deployment_generator(
  caps,
  deps,
  cam_long = 20,
  max_dur = 100,
  szn_filter = TRUE,
  cam_filter = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{caps}{A data frame of camera trap observations that contains date/time information for each image. It must include columns named \code{eventStart}, \code{deploymentID}, \code{dataSource}, and \code{locationName}.}

\item{deps}{A data frame of camera deployments that contains location information for each camera deployment. It must include columns named \code{deploymentID} and \code{locationName}.}

\item{cam_long}{A numeric value (in days) representing the maximum gap between detections before a new survey is started. Defaults to 20 days.}

\item{max_dur}{A numeric value (in days) representing the maximum duration a survey can last before starting a new one. Defaults to 100 days.}

\item{szn_filter}{A logical value indicating whether to filter out short survey periods. If \code{TRUE}, surveys with fewer detections within a defined time frame will be combined with adjacent surveys. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cam_filter}{A logical value indicating whether to use the cam_long argument to look for natural breaks in detections. This is best set to \code{FALSE} when there are manually created start/stop records when a data provider has not provided all records. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame based on the \code{caps} input, but with additional columns:
\describe{
\item{new_deploymentID}{A new deployment identifier that reflects updated deployment groups.}
\item{new_deploymentGroups}{A new survey identifier that represents the adjusted survey groupings based on the detection intervals and survey duration.}
\item{new_locationName}{A new location identifier combining location and deployment information.}
}
}
\description{
This function analyzes date/time information from camera trap images to identify spatially and temporally discrete sampling efforts.
The function updates the input data with new survey and deployment IDs by analyzing spatial and temporal patterns in camera detections.
Users can specify the maximum duration of a survey and the maximum gap between detections before a new survey is triggered.
This is useful for organizing images into surveys and deployments for further analysis.
}
\details{
This function assumes that camera coordinates and date/time data have been verified for accuracy and are free of errors.
Spatially distinct groupings of cameras should be indicated in the \code{locationName} column in the deployments data frame.
The function will:
\enumerate{
\item Group detections into surveys based on the \code{max_dur} (maximum survey duration) and \code{cam_long} (maximum gap between detections).
\item Assign new deployment IDs and survey IDs, ensuring each deployment has unique identifiers based on the adjusted time periods.
\item Handle cameras that are active over long periods and split their data based on natural breaks in detections or user-defined thresholds.
\item Optionally filter out short survey periods based on the \code{szn_filter} parameter.
