\title{Verify Location Names Using State-Specific Landscape Shapefiles}
\usage{
locationName_verification_national(dep, dist)
}
\arguments{
\item{dep}{The deployments tabular data containing information about each camera deployment, including latitude and longitude columns (either `Latitude`/`Longitude` or `latitude`/`longitude`).}

\item{dist}{A logical value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). If `TRUE`, the function uses Euclidean distance to find the nearest known landscape feature for deployments with missing values.}
}
\value{
A new column appended to the deployments data frame with an updated `locationName` column, indicating the verified landscape (e.g., National Park, State Forest) for each deployment.
}
\description{
This function verifies camera deployment locations by intersecting provided coordinates with landscape shapefiles
specific to Australian states. It operates at multiple levels, starting with a nationwide CAPAD dataset and then
checking National Parks, State Forests, and other land types based on the provided state.
Optionally, the function can also use Euclidean distance to find the nearest known landscape feature for deployments
with missing values and visualize results using a Leaflet map.

}
\details{
The function searches for landscape shapefiles in a specified directory, organized by state. To perform a national-level
check, it loads the CAPAD Terrestrial shapefile, found at:
\code{"~/Dropbox/ECL spatial layers repository/Australian spatial layers GIS data/AUS/CAPAD_Terrestrial_land_use/Collaborative_Australian_Protected_Areas_Database_(CAPAD)_2022_-_Terrestrial/"}
This path should be modified if the CAPAD data is stored in a different directory. The function follows these steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Users specify a state (e.g., "QLD", "NSW") to search for relevant shapefiles in the \code{Landscapes_path} directory.
  \item The function processes National Parks, State Forests, and other land types within each state, renaming columns to
  standardized formats for consistency.
  \item For deployments without a landscape designation, users can opt to find the nearest landscape feature based on
  Euclidean distance, with a configurable threshold.

# Example usage:
dep <- data.frame(
  deploymentID = c("dep1", "dep2"),
  Latitude = c(-33.8688, -27.4698),
  Longitude = c(151.2093, 153.0251)
)
dep$locationName <- locationName_verification_national(dep, dist = TRUE)
table(deps$locationName)
