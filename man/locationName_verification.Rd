\title{Verify Location Names Using State-Specific Landscape Shapefiles}
\usage{
locationName_verification(dep, Landscapes_path, dist, state = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dep}{The deployments tabular data containing information about each camera deployment, including latitude and longitude columns (either `Latitude`/`Longitude` or `latitude`/`longitude`).}

\item{Landscapes_path}{The path to the directory containing the landscape shapefiles, which should be organized by state.}

\item{dist}{A logical value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). If `TRUE`, the function uses Euclidean distance to find the nearest known landscape feature for deployments with missing values.}

\item{state}{A character string representing the Australian state where the study is located (e.g., "QLD", "NSW", "VIC"). If `NULL`, the user will be prompted to enter a state.}
}
\value{
A new column appended to the deployments data frame with an updated `locationName` column, indicating the verified landscape (e.g., National Park, State Forest) for each deployment.
}
\description{
This function verifies camera deployment locations by intersecting provided coordinates with landscape shapefiles specific to Australian states.
It works at multiple levels, starting by checking National Parks and State Forests based on the state provided, and then fills in any missing values based on proximity to known landscapes.
Optionally, the function can also visualize results using a Leaflet map.
}
\details{
The function operates in a stepwise fashion:
\enumerate{
  \item Users provide the state (e.g., "QLD", "NSW") to search for relevant shapefiles in a specified directory.
  \item The function works through National Parks, State Forests, and other land types for each state.
  \item If there are missing values, users are prompted to use distance to the nearest known landscape feature to fill in the gaps.
}
The function handles shapefiles differently for each state, automatically renaming columns to standardized formats to facilitate further analysis.

# Example usage:
dep <- data.frame(
  deploymentID = c("dep1", "dep2"),
  Latitude = c(-33.8688, -27.4698),
  Longitude = c(151.2093, 153.0251)
)
Landscapes_path <- "~/Dropbox/ECL spatial layers repository/Australian spatial layers GIS data/AUS/Landscapes/"
dep$locationName <- locationName_verification(dep, Landscapes_path, dist = TRUE, state = "NSW")
table(deps$locationName)
