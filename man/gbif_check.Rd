\title{Check overlap with GBIF species ranges}
\usage{
gbif_check(deps, obs, tif_folder)
}
\arguments{
\item{deps}{The deployment file with camera coordinates which will take the average these must be labelled as Latitude and Longitude or X and Y, the code will check for both.}

\item{obs}{The observations file which will generate the species list to check. There must be a column called Species or scientificName}

\item{tif_folder}{The folder containing the GBIF files to be checked this can be the path it self or a vector.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following columns:
\enumerate{
  \item Species: The binomial nomenclature of the species name.
  \item Overlapping: A logical value indicating whether the species overlaps with the GBIF raster.
  \item File_Not_Found: Indicates whether the GBIF file for the species could not be found.
}
}
\description{
This function will carry out a GBIF range check to flag for species that might be incorrectly identified.
It does this by checking against polygons predicting species ranges generated from GBIF records.
This is not perfect, but it provides a quick flag to check for anything that might not make sense
e.g. gorillas in the centre of Australia.
}
\details{
The GBIF raster layers that this function relies upon do not live in this R package (for now). These are maintined in the WildObs DropBox account and can be granted access with permission.

\examples{
gbif_folder = "path/to/GBIF/files"
gbif_overlap_result = gbif_check(dep, caps, gbif_folder)
print(gbif_overlap_result)
