\title{Determine Australian State from Coordinates}
\usage{
AUS_state_locator(deps)
}
\arguments{
\item{deps}{A data frame containing camera deployment data. This must include columns for `deploymentID`, `Latitude` or `latitude`, and `Longitude` or `longitude`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original deployment data, along with an additional `state` column that contains the abbreviated Australian state or territory code (e.g., "NSW", "QLD").
}
\description{
This function uses the `ozmaps` library to determine the Australian state in which each camera deployment is located, based on the average coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each deployment.
It assigns state codes (e.g., "NSW", "QLD") to the input data based on the geographic location of the deployments.
}
\details{
The function expects the deployment data to have columns for latitude and longitude, either named `Latitude`/`Longitude` or `latitude`/`longitude`.
It calculates the average coordinates for each deployment and uses the `ozmaps` package to intersect these with Australian state boundaries.
If any deployments cannot be matched to a state, an error will be thrown.
}
\examples{
# Example data
deps <- data.frame(
  deploymentID = c("dep1", "dep2"),
  Latitude = c(-33.8688, -27.4698),
  Longitude = c(151.2093, 153.0251)
)

# Run the function to find states
deps_with_states <- AUS_state_locator(deps)
print(deps_with_states)
