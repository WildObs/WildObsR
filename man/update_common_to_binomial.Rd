\title{Update common names to binomial nomenclature}
\usage{
update_common_to_binomial(obs_data, verified_data, interactive = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs_data}{A data frame containing observation data with a species column (either "scientificName" or "Species")}

\item{verified_data}{A data frame with verified species information containing columns: Common_name, user_provided_name, and binomial_verified}

\item{interactive}{Logical. If TRUE, prompts user to choose replacement when multiple matches exist (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
The obs_data data frame with scientificName column updated with verified binomial nomenclature where matches were found
}
\description{
This function is used to convert species names from common names into binomial nomenclature, based off the WildObs verified taxonomy database.
This is acheived by taking each missing species name, searching the common name column of binomial verifeid and suggesting replacements to the user from binomial_verified for any matches to the common name.
If a common_name is not found it will tell you.
}
\details{
The function can work interactivtly, allowing users to verify a name is correct or not.
If more than binomial name is found it, will present options to specify the correct name by entering numbers.
If nothing matches hit enter to skip that species.
It ignores capitals. A replacement will be done on the Species column of the caps frame with the user selected replacements.
Interactive defaults to FALSE, because knitting a Rmd document with an interactive funciton is not logical.
Any time there is more than one different binomial name to replace the common name,
it gets skipped for closer inspection later, but prints a message to let us know.
