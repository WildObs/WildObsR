\title{Update common names to binomial nomenclature}
\usage{
update_common_to_binomial(data_caps, data_verified, interactive = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_caps}{The observations tabular data that contains all observed species, with names stored in a column named either 'Species' or 'scientificName'}

\item{data_verified}{The WildObs verified taxonomy database, containing all user provided names (common and not) and the corresponding verified binomial nomenclature with links to GBIF & NCBI}

\item{interactive}{A logical value. If 'TRUE', the user will manually verify when there are multiple different binomial names. If 'FALSE', multiple binomial names are skipped.}
}
\value{
The function updates the species names in the observations tabular data (parameter 'data_caps') with the verified binomial nomenclature.
}
\description{
This function is used to convert species names from common names into binomial nomenclature, based off the WildObs verified taxonomy database.
This is acheived by taking each missing species name, searching the common name column of binomial verifeid and suggesting replacements to the user from binomial_verified for any matches to the common name.
If a common_name is not found it will tell you.
}
\details{
The function can work interactivtly, allowing users to verify a name is correct or not.
If more than binomial name is found it, will present options to specify the correct name by entering numbers.
If nothing matches hit enter to skip that species.
It ignores capitals. A replacement will be done on the Species column of the caps frame with the user selected replacements.
Interactive defaults to FALSE, because knitting a Rmd document with an interactive funciton is not logical.
Any time there is more than one different binomial name to replace the common name,
it gets skipped for closer inspection later, but prints a message to let us know.
