\title{Generate spatially distinct sampling units}
\usage{
spatial_hexagon_generator(data, scales)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe of covariates that includes at minimum: \code{deploymentID}, \code{locationName},\code{deploymentGroups}, \code{source}, \code{latitude}, and \code{longitude}. These columns are found in WildObs' camtrapDP-formatted Frictionless Data Packages.}

\item{scales}{A numeric vector representing the area of hexagonal grid cells in \strong{square meters (m²)}.
Values smaller than 1e6 (1 km²) are allowed. Scale names will be auto-generated using appropriate m² or km² units.}
}
\value{
A dataframe including the original data plus additional columns for each scale:
\itemize{
\item \verb{polygon_<scale>}: spatially distinct cell assignments.
\item \verb{cellID_<scale>}: temporally and spatially distinct cell assignments (appending contributor info).
}
}
\description{
This function generates spatially distinct hexagonal sampling units to group nearby camera trap deployment.
It accounts for spatial and temporal overlap between deployments across different contributors to ensure that sampling units are truly independent.
}
\details{
The function works by overlaying a hexagonal grid of scales determined by the user to group deploymentIDs per \code{locationName}.
Each deploymentID is then assigned a unique \code{cellID} (temporally distinct) and \code{polygon} ID (spatially distinct) across all provided scales.
If multiple contributors sample the same cell in the same time window, their deployments are grouped into a common code.

# load data
dp = frictionless::read_package("/Users/zachary_amir/Dropbox/WildObs master folder/WildObs GitHub Data Storage/data_clean/Step 4 DataPackages/ZAmir_QLD_Wet_Tropics_2022/datapackage.json")
# extract covariates resource
data = frictionless::read_resource(dp, "covariates")
## assign spatial scales
scales = c(1000000, 3000000) # number refer area (in square meters) covered by the cell
## add dataSource to the covarites
data$source = dp$contributors[[1]]$tag
