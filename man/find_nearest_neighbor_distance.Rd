\title{Calculate Nearest Neighbor Distances for Camera Trap Locations}
\usage{
find_nearest_neighbor_distance(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The deployments tabular data containing information about each camera trap location. It must include the columns `locationID`, `longitude`, and `latitude`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{locationID}{The unique identifier for each camera trap location.}
  \item{nearestNeighborID}{The `locationID` of the nearest neighboring camera trap.}
  \item{distance}{The distance (in meters) between the camera trap and its nearest neighbor.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the distance between each camera trap location (`locationID`) and its nearest neighbor within the dataset.
It uses geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude) to create a spatial data frame, computes the distance matrix between all locations, and returns the nearest neighbor and distance for each location.
}
\details{
The function works in the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item It ensures that only distinct `locationID` values are considered by removing duplicates.
  \item A spatial data frame is created from the longitude and latitude coordinates of each `locationID`.
  \item A distance matrix is computed between all locations, and for each `locationID`, the nearest neighbor and the distance to it are identified.
  \item The diagonal of the distance matrix is set to infinity to avoid a location being considered its own nearest neighbor.
}
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
data <- data.frame(
  locationID = c("loc1", "loc2", "loc3"),
  longitude = c(151.2093, 153.0251, 150.644),
  latitude = c(-33.8688, -27.4698, -34.9285)
)

# Find the nearest neighbor for each location
nearest_neighbors <- find_nearest_neighbor_distance(data)
print(nearest_neighbors)
