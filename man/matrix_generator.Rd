\title{Generate Detection History and Covariate Matrices from camtrapDP Formatted Data}
\usage{
matrix_generator(
  obs,
  covs,
  dur,
  w,
  site_covs,
  obs_covs,
  all_locationNames,
  scientificNames,
  type,
  individuals,
  cap_count = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{A \code{data.frame} of observations. This must include columns for date-time information
(e.g., \code{eventStart}, \code{eventEnd}, \code{observationStart}, \code{observationEnd}),
a species identifier (\code{scientificName}), and a unique identifier for sampling units
(e.g., \code{cellID_10km} in spatially resampled data from \code{WildObsR::resample_covariates_and_observations()} or \code{deploymentID} in regular camtrap DP data).}

\item{covs}{A \code{data.frame} of covariates. This must include sampling start/end dates (e.g.,
\code{samplingStart}, \code{samplingEnd} in spatially resampled data from \code{WildObsR::resample_covariates_and_observations()} or \code{deploymentStart}, \code{deploymentEnd} in regular camtrap DP data), spatial identifiers (matching \code{obs}), and additional site-level covariate columns.}

\item{dur}{A numeric value indicating the maximum sampling duration (in days) where a population is assumed to be closed to changes in size.}

\item{w}{A numeric value specifying the length (in days) of each sampling occasion window that is used to compress the detection history matrix to improve model performance by increasing detection probability.}

\item{site_covs}{A character vector of column names in \code{covs} to be used as site-level covariates.}

\item{obs_covs}{A character vector of column names in \code{obs} to be used as observation-level covariates.}

\item{all_locationNames}{A logical indicating whether all locationName values should be included (\code{TRUE})
or only locationNames with species detections (\code{FALSE}) should be included.}

\item{scientificNames}{A character vector of species names to generate matrices for. Each species
will be processed separately.}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of model. Use \code{"abundance"} to generate a count history matrix using count data
or \code{"occupancy"} to generate a detection history matrix using presence/absence data.}

\item{individuals}{A character string specifying the method for aggregating individual counts used in the count history matrix.
Use \code{"sum"} to sum detections across occasions or \code{"max"} to take the maximum value.}

\item{cap_count}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function will automatically cap observed counts for each species
based on its mean and maximum observed group size to prevent extremely large counts from negatively affecting model fit.
Species with high mean or maximum individual counts will have their values capped (e.g., at 3, 5, or 7), while others retain full counts.
Default is \code{FALSE}, meaning no capping is applied.}
}
\value{
A named \code{list} where each element corresponds to a species. Each element is itself a
list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{detection_matrix}}{A matrix of detection (or count) data with rows representing
sampling units and columns representing sampling occasion windows.}
\item{\code{site_level_covariates}}{A \code{data.frame} of site-level covariates used in the analysis.}
\item{\code{observation_level_covariates}}{A \code{list} of matrices containing observation-level covariate, where each matrix is aligned with the detection history matrix.}
}
}
\description{
This function processes camera trapping data formatted using the camtrapDP data standard to generate detection history matrices along with site-level and observation-level covariate matrices. These outputs can then be used for hierarchical occupancy or abundance modeling (e.g., with the \code{unmarked} package).
}
\details{
The function performs several key steps:

\enumerate{
\item \strong{Data Validation:} Checks are performed to ensure that:
\itemize{
\item The identifier column (e.g., \code{cellID} or \code{deploymentID}) is consistent across
\code{obs} and \code{covs}.
\item Specified site-level and observation-level covariate columns are present and contain no NA values.
\item Date-time columns in both \code{obs} and \code{covs} are properly formatted as \code{POSIXct}.
\item The provided species names (\code{scientificNames}) exist in the \code{obs} table.
}
\item \strong{Timezone Adjustment:} Date-time values are updated to the appropriate timezone based on
the mean latitude and longitude of the sites using \code{lutz::tz_lookup_coords} and \code{lubridate::with_tz}.
\item \strong{Date Sequence and Sampling Occasions:} A complete sequence of dates is generated for each
sampling unit and an index is assigned to each sampling occasion.
\item \strong{Matrix Generation:} For each species, a detection history matrix is created by aligning
observations to their respective sampling occasions. The matrix can contain either count data (for
abundance models) or binary presence/absence data (for occupancy models).
\item \strong{Observation-level Covariate Formatting:} Observation covariates are organized into matrices
that align with the detection history matrix and are compressed to match sampling occasion windows.

# Example usage with pre-processed camera trap data, accessed from WildObs:

# Load the general use WildObs API key

# Extract resources from the data package

obs  <- frictionless::read_resource(dp, "observations")
deps <- frictionless::read_resource(dp, "deployments")

# Assign spatial scales
# 'scales' defines the area (in square meters) covered by the hexagonal cell
scales <- c(1000000, 3000000)

# Add data source to the covariates
covs$source <- dp$contributors[[1]]$tag
# Generate spatial hexagons based on the provided scales

# Set the method for aggregating the total number of individuals detected:

# Specify observation-level covariate variables derived from deployments.
# These variables capture information that varies in space and time.
